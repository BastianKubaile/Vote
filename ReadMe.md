# Vote is a React App that can be used to create online polls
This is the fronted for the Vote App, written with React. The App needs a [backend Server](https://github.com/BastianKubaile/vote_server), which is written in NodeJS. The App supports similiar functionality to pingo.coactum.de or strawpoll.me.

## How to Use
First you need to make sure the backend server is running as well as the MongoDB database. For that look into this [repo](https://github.com/BastianKubaile/vote_server).
After that navigate where you want to save the files and run
```
git clone https://github.com/BastianKubaile/Vote
cd vote
npm install
npm start
```
That's it.
